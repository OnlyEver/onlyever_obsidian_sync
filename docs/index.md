💬 This document is designed to offer fundamental insights into the
workings of the system. We’ve crafted the documentation with simplicity
in mind, ensuring that individuals with non-technical backgrounds can
grasp the essence of the system. This is why, some technical
terminologies are loosely used. While this approach facilitates
understanding for beginners, individuals with technical expertise may
find that certain details are presented in a simplified manner that
diverges from precise technical terminology and the norm.
